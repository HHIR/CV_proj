Evaluating Object Detection with Custom YOLOv8 Architecture
==============

For our final project in the Computer Vision course at Sapienza University in 2024, we customized YOLOv8 models to get better at spotting objects. We organized our data carefully, used cutting-edge training methods like gradually increasing learning rates and adding variety to our data, and closely checked our results to really understand how well our object detection works.
